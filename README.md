# Python MD5 Hashing Utility

## Overview
This utility is a Python script designed to perform two main functions:
- **Generate an MD5 hash** of a provided password combined with a predefined salt.
- **Verify a password** against a stored hash to check if the input password is correct.

## Features
- Generate a secure MD5 hash by combining a user's password with a salt.
- Verify user passwords against a pre-stored MD5 hash.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Setup
No additional libraries are required as the script utilizes Pythonâ€™s built-in `hashlib` module. Simply download the script or clone this repository to get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mmaaz47/MD5-Hashing-Algorithm.git
